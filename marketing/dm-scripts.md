# DM Scripts & Outreach Templates

## Instagram/Facebook DM Scripts

### Script 1: Cold Outreach (Electricians)
**Target:** Electricians posting job photos, asking about software in trade groups
**Approach:** Value-first, no pitch in first message

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
```
Hey [name]! Saw your work on [specific post/project]. Looks like solid
work mate. Quick question — do you use any software for your quoting
or is it still the old pen-and-paper / email method?
```

**Message 2 (if they respond with pain/frustration):**
```
Yeah I hear that a lot. I actually built something specifically for
tradies like yourself — it runs inside Google Sheets so there's
literally zero learning curve.

You can try a free demo here if you're curious (no sign-up needed):
https://tradeanchor.com.au#test-drive

Takes about 2 minutes and you'll see exactly how it works.
```

**Message 3 (if interested):**
```
Awesome! Happy to jump on a quick 15-min call to show you how it'd
work for your specific setup. No pressure at all — just want to make
sure it's actually a good fit before anything else.

Here's my calendar: https://calendly.com/billing-tradeanchor/15min

Or if you prefer WhatsApp: https://wa.me/61494186989

### Script 2: Facebook Group Engagement
**Target:** Electricians in Facebook groups asking about job management, quoting, ServiceM8, Jobber
**Approach:** Answer their question first, then soft mention

**Comment Template:**
```
Great question! I've tried a few options and honestly most of them
are overkill (and expensive) for what tradies actually need.

I ended up building a system that runs inside Google Sheets — no
monthly fees, no learning curve, and you actually own your data.

Happy to share more details if anyone's interested. Just shoot me
a message.
```

**Follow-up DM (when they message):**
```
Hey [name], thanks for reaching out! So basically Flowio turns your
Google Sheets into a full quoting + job management system.

One tap to generate a professional PDF quote, auto-SMS it to the
client, they accept online, it books into your calendar, and you
can even collect payment through Stripe.

Best part — it's a one-time setup fee ($1,997 or 3x $699), not a
monthly subscription that bleeds you dry.

### Script 3: Warm Referral (From Existing Customer)
```
Hey [name]! [Referrer name] mentioned you might be interested in
streamlining your quoting. They've been using Flowio and said it's
been a game-changer for their [trade] business.

Basically it's a system that runs inside Google Sheets — generates
professional PDF quotes in one tap, sends them to clients via SMS,
and handles acceptance + payment automatically.

[Referrer name] mentioned the referral deal too — you'd both get
$200 off if you sign up.

Want to see how it works? Free demo here (no sign-up):
https://tradeanchor.com.au#test-drive

Or happy to chat: https://calendly.com/billing-tradeanchor/15min

### Script 4: ServiceM8/Jobber Frustration Response
**Target:** Tradies complaining about ServiceM8/Jobber costs or complexity

```
I hear you mate. I was in the same boat — paying $XX/month for
software I only used 10% of.

That's actually why I built Flowio. It does the core stuff tradies
actually need (quoting, SMS, job tracking, payments) but runs inside
Google Sheets. So:

- No learning curve (it's just a spreadsheet)
- No monthly fees (one-time setup)
- You own all your data forever

If you're curious, there's a free interactive demo on the website:
https://tradeanchor.com.au#test-drive

No sign-up needed. Takes 2 minutes.

## Response Handling

### If they say "too expensive":
```
Totally get it. Two things:

1. We have a Lite version at $497 — just the quoting module.
   You can upgrade later for $1,500 if you want the full system.

2. The full version has a payment plan: 3x $699/month.

Either way, there's no monthly fee after that. Compare that to
ServiceM8 at $29-$349/month — over 2 years that's $700-$8,400.

Happy to run the numbers for your specific situation:
https://calendly.com/billing-tradeanchor/15min
```

### If they say "I'll think about it":
```
No worries at all! Take your time.

If it helps, here's a quick 2-min demo you can check out whenever:
https://tradeanchor.com.au#test-drive

And feel free to WhatsApp me anytime if questions come up:
https://wa.me/61494186989
```

### If they say "does it work for [trade]?":
```
Great question! Flowio works for any trade that sends quotes —
electricians, plumbers, HVAC, painters, landscapers, etc.

The quoting system is fully customisable — you set up your own
price list with your specific items and rates.

Want to see it in action for [trade]? The demo has sample items
but I can show you how it'd look with your specific services:
https://calendly.com/billing-tradeanchor/15min
```

### If they ghost (no response after 48h):
Let the Make.com S4 automation handle this — it sends an auto-SMS
at 48h and a final email at 5 days. No manual follow-up needed.
